# BrowserChoice
The indent of this tool is that you get a choice with which browser you want to open a link or a associated HTML file. Please check the README.md file as well as the wiki for a short intro and a rudimentary documentation ;)

I'm still unsure where to do the main dev, hence I'm still at GitLab with the files and additional information.
